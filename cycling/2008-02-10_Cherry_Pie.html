Racing season's here!

<p>
I can't decide whether I'm excited or terrified.  Late last summer, I upgraded
categories, from Cat 3 to Cat 2, the second highest of the amateur categories.
Of the next five races I did, I only finished two of them.  It was a bit of a
wake up call.  The bell curve, it seems, goes on and on and on.

<p>
Of course, the same thing happened to me when I upgraded from Cat 4 to Cat 3,
and after another winter of pounding out the miles, I was competitive in the
3's.  Hoping for a similar result this time, I've been slogging away at the bike
all winter.  Despite changing jobs and adding at least two hours of commuting
to every day, I've mostly met my weekly hour targets.  I also got a lifting
coach--Mike of Crossfit Oakland--to work on my power over short intervals.

<p>
All the same, I'm plagued by lingering doubts.  Based on the numbers from my
power meter, I can say with certainty that I'm faster than before.  But I have
no idea if I'm fast enough.

<p>
When you train this much, you have to give up something.  Usually you give up
a lot of things.  Going out.  Drinking.  Traveling to see friends.  Projects.
What if it was all in vain?  What if I've wasted six months being a cycling
ascetic, only to get dropped in three fifths of my races for a whole season?

<hr width="20%">

<p>
A week from now, I plan to race Valley of the Sun in Arizona, a Cat 2-only
race.  But I need a tune-up before then, and there's only one real race this
season before that: the Cherry Pie Criterium in Napa.  A criterium is a race
of many laps around a short loop.  They're usually run by time.  This one, for
example, is sixty minutes, meaning that the promoters will time our first
thirty minutes or so, estimate how many laps it will take to make an hour, and
then put up lap cards starting at five to go.  In addition, throughout the
race there are several <em>primes</em>: as we cross the finish line on some
lap, the promoter will ring a bell indicating that the first rider to cross
the line the next time will win a prize.  By ringing the bell frequently,
promoters keep the pace high and the race interesting.

<p>
Besides being well timed at a week before Valley of the Sun, the Cherry
Pie course also has a small hill, which is good for me, as my skinny bones
tend to get up hills faster than other racers of similar abilities.  So Cherry
Pie would seem like the perfect warm-up race, except that I won't only be
racing other Cat 2's.  There aren't enough of us to fill a field in most
races, so promoters tend to group us with the Cat 1's and the pros.  And with
the Tour of California starting the same weekend as Valley of the Sun, the
local pros are also looking for a good tune-up race.

<p>
A few days before Cherry Pie, I take a look at the start list, and I almost
choke.  Lucas Euser, an up-and-coming pro who will start the Giro d'Italia
this year, will be there.  So will Jackson Stewart, fresh from the Tour of
Quatar, where he was sprinting against Tom Boonen, arguably the top sprinter
in the world right now.  And as if that weren't enough, Freddie Rodriguez,
three-time U.S. national road race champion, is on the list as well.

<p>
I've read about these guys in VeloNews for years, and I'm quite sure they can
ride the legs right off me.  I'm glad I'm only doing this race as a tune-up.
(I'm also pretty stoked at the opportunity to line up next to them at the
start.)  If I so much as finish this race, I tell myself, the Cat 2's at
Valley of the Sun are going to seem a lot less intimidating.

<p>
Racing Cherry Pie with me are two teammates from my new team, Metromint
Cycling: Julian and Ryan.  Julian is also new to Metromint.  He was a fast
junior (under 18) racer, and he's now a student at UC Santa Cruz.  Ryan is a
member of Stanford's cycling team, last year's national collegiate champions.
Before the race, we discuss strategy over email.  I say my plan is to hang on
for dear life, and--rather optimistically--that if by some miracle I feel
good, I'll go for a prime or two.

<hr width="20%">

<p>
On Sunday morning, Lucy and I drive up to the race in the Metromint team car.
The parking area is super crowded by the time we get there, but after
delivering a case of Metromint for the promoter to hand out as prime prizes,
we're directed to a front row parking spot, right by the finish line.  We also
meet Lucy's friend Jen, who has come to watch the race.

<p>
I take a walk around the course to check out the pavement.
It starts on a slight downhill, takes a fast right-hand corner, sweeps
around to the left before taking two tight, but flat, left-hand turns, then
takes a slow curve to the right before climbing back up the hill to the finish
line.  It isn't a steep climb, I can do it in my big chainring, but I'm
sure it will nonetheless be decisive at race pace.  After the line, it's a
tight U-turn and past the starting line again.

<p>
After walking the course, I pick up my number and talk to my teammates in
other categories about how their races played out.  Ali, one of our Cat 3
women, points out that in her race it was easiest to move up through the pack
on the short stretch before the uphill while others were busy steeling
themselves for the climb to come.

<p>
With that tip in mind, I pin my number to my jersey, set my bike on the
stationary trainer, and start my warmup.  All too soon, it's time to line up.
I reset my power meter, check that I'm in a good gear for the start, and make
small talk while we wait for the whistle.

<hr width="20%">

<p>
The race starts and for what seems like an eternity I can't clip into my
pedal.  By the time I do, I'm at the back of the pack.  Luckily for me, though,
Ali's advice pays off, and I move up on stretch before the hill over the next
few laps.  

<p>
In fact, Ali's trick works a little too well, and I soon find myself sitting
in fifth place--way too close to the front--there's not nearly enough draft up
here.  Worse still, the next time we cross the line, the promoter rings the
bell.

<p>
Now I'm faced with a real dilemma.  Half of my brain is saying, "PRIME!
ATTACK!  You have perfect position!"  The other half is saying, "Are you
crazy?  You're lucky you haven't already been dropped.  If you go for that
prime, you'll be spent, and you'll get dropped for sure."  I think about what
I said over email, that if I was feeling good, I'd go for a prime.  I'm
sitting here, in fifth wheel.  I'm clearly not feeling bad.  And yeah, maybe
I'll get dropped.  But Julian and Ryan can see me--they see how well placed I
am for this--and if I don't go for it, they'll never respect me again.

<p>
So as we come around to the short straight stretch before the hill, I jump
like all hell.  Flying off the saddle, I yank on the bars with my right hand
while crushing my right pedal towards the ground.  Then the left side.  Again
and again.  As I start to spin out, I sit, put my head down, and hammer
towards the line.  My hamstrings are killing me, but I can see I've left most
of the pack behind.  Dig! Dig! Dig!

<p>
Alas, at the last second another rider, Bryan Larsen, comes around me and
takes the prime by inches.

<p>
I have only a few seconds to be mad.  Bryan keeps the pace up as we take the
U-turn, and he starts hammering even harder as we start the descent.  Behind
me someone yells, "Go! Go! Go!"  I look back and...my attack has opened up a
gap on the main field.  I pull through, eyes crossed in exhaustion, and
quickly wave the next guy through, counting my companions as I drift to the
back of the line and into the draft.  There are nine of us, including Jackson
Stewart and Lucas Euser.

<p>

and white jersey.  Lucas is in the back.</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The first moments of a breakaway are always tenuous.  It never, ever feels
like it's going to work.  We grit our teeth nonetheless, taking our pulls,
each rotating through, knowing that so long as we stay off, none of us will
finish worse than ninth.  Each lap we see the pack charging up the hill as we
descend the other side.  Each time it seems as hopeless as before.

<p>
And then, without any warning, we're suddenly twice as far ahead.  They've
given up, unable to coordinate their chase enough to catch us.

<p>
In truth, they've given up just in time for me.  Each time I pull through into
the wind, I wonder how I'm going to stay on.  At thirty minutes in, I think to
myself, "There's no way I can do this."  But Ryan and Julian are back there,
counting on me.  If I fall back, Metromint will have no one in the break, and
neither of them is likely to be able to bridge up to the break alone.  

<p>
Each time we hit the hill, I start to fade a bit, drifting back through our
group.  I pass Lucy and Jen, and they yell like there is no tomorrow.  I stand
up, mash the pedals and catch back on, recovering in the draft down the hill.
Lap after lap passes this way.

<p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td><img src="2008-02-10_Grimace.jpg"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Grimacing up the hill.</i></td></tr>

<p>
At forty-five minutes in, I start thinking I might just pull it off.  When I
see the lap card indicating five laps to go, I'm sure I'm home free.  We have
over a minute on the field now; there's no way they'll catch us.  All I have
to do is hold this pace for another five laps.

<p>
Of course, once everyone else realizes the pack is certain not to catch us,
the motivation to work together vanishes, and the attacks begin.  As we come
up the hill on the next lap, Jackson attacks, jumping off the front of our
group.  I felt it coming.  I feared it in advance.  And as I watch it happen,
I think, "Oh, shit!  I have to follow that?"  But I jump anyway, digging as
hard as I can.

<p>
The size of our group saves me.  I don't catch Jackson's wheel, but Lucas
does.  Someone else catches Lucas's wheel, and so on down the line, until I
catch the eighth wheel of the group right before the turn-around.  I might
have made it if we were only seven.  Six, however, I'm not so sure about.  But
making it is enough, and I recover in the draft over the next lap.

<p>
As soon as I've recovered, we're back at the hill, and Lucas attacks.  Once
again, I'm saved by our numbers, just catching the draft of the last wheel.
Once again I sit in the draft to recover.

<p>
Luckily for me, there is no attack on the next two laps.  Everyone seems to
have decided that if Jackson and Lucas can't get away, neither can anyone
else.  With a lap to go, Lucas says, "Drag race."  We all laugh.

<p>
I retreat into my thoughts, thinking about how I want to finish this race.  In
truth, I'd like to jump early, just before the start of the hill.  It worked
for me in the prime.  No one expects the newbie Cat 2 to go first, and the
little gap I'd get from their surprise might just be enough.  At the same
time, I've sat in the draft for five laps in a row now, resting while the pros
continued to work in the wind, and I feel like it would be a gross violation
of cycling etiquette to jump first.  I decide instead to sit on Jackson's
wheel.  I know I can't outsprint him, but I figure that in hanging on as long
as I can, perhaps I'll beat several others.

<p>
As we approach the hill for the last time, our pace slows to a crawl.  I can
feel everyone looking at everyone else, wondering who will go first.  It's
Jackson.  He jumps, and we all jump with him.  As planned, I have his wheel,
but I can't match his jump, and I quickly lose his draft.  I catch another
wheel, now at the back of the sprint.  But the hill is long, and I
hold on.  With thirty yards to go, I pass Justin Fraga of BPG / Montano Velo.
I almost catch Bryan Larsen, the rider who beat me in the prime, but the line
comes to soon, and he takes it by inches.

<p>
I am momentarily bummed.  I am also completely out of breath, and I get only
one foot out of the pedals before sitting--then laying--on the ground twenty
yards from the finish line.  

<p>
And then the whole magnitude of what I've just done hits me.  I just placed
8th in a Pro/1/2 race!  The same guys who dropped me three out of five times
last summer!  I was in a break with a bunch of pros for almost an hour!

<p>
Still laying on the ground, I throw my hands up in the air in celebration,
just in time to punch Jackson's chainring as he rides by.  It hurts like hell,
and I don't care at all.  I lay there, smiling.  It is a beautiful day, the
sky is blue above me, and suddenly the whole winter feels totally worth it.

<hr width="20%">

<p>
After the race, the group of us gather around the announcer's table to collect
our winnings.  My eighth place is worth $40 and a cherry pie.  They also give
me the "Cycles Gladiator Most Aggressive Rider" award, including a bottle of
Cycles Gladiator wine, for initiating the breakaway when I went for the prime.  

<p>
I also run into Ali and thank her for the tip about where to move up through
the field.  She says, "Remember: this is the day."  Or at least, that's what I
think she says.  My race-addled brain can't make sense of it at all, though,
and I ask, "What?"  She smiles and says, "This is the day that you beat
Freddie Rodriguez."

<p>
I think about it for a moment, and then I smile.  He would have destroyed me
if it had come to a bunch sprint.  But it didn't.  I was in the break, and he
was in the main group.  And so I smile the whole way home.
