<p>
After my move back to California prematurely ended my 2006 road
season, I decided that I had no choice but to race cyclocross this
fall.  And if you're gonna go, you gotta go big.  So this August I
bought a Louis Garneau Steeple X frame and fork, a set of Spooky
brakes, and a pair of FSA chainrings in 38x46, stripped my road bike
bare, and built up a new cyclocross rig with the parts.  When your
only bike is a CX bike, I figured, you'll put in the training hours
for fear of embarrassment if nothing else.

<p>
My goal for the season is to win the Velo Bella Surf City Series in
the Men's B category.  To that end, I spent the latter half of August
and the first half of September putting in base miles, learning to run
again, and practicing my CX skills.  On September 19, I rode the
Wildcat Canyon HCTT in 9:53, besting my previous record by almost a
minute.  The interval workouts I've done since then have only further
cemented my confidence in my fitness.

<p>
I have far less confidence in my handling skills.  Rather than find
out what needs polishing during my first important race, then, I've
decided to race the Central Coast Series race at Fort Ord this
weekend.  I'm particularly worried--rightly so, it turns out--about my
inexperience with my new Crank Bros pedals.

<p>
The Fort Ord course is held at an abandoned Army base near Salinas,
CA.  Signs abound warning visitors not to stray off trail where they
might encounter unexploded ordinance.  Crashing seems even less fun
than usual.

<p>
I've decided to race this one for the West Coast division of Essex
County Velo, or "Essex County Villa" as the woman at registration
tries to spell it.  The unrecognized jersey gives me an air of
mystique; confused looks abound as I warm up on my trainer.  I can
feel the Mental Edge tilting in my favor.

<p>
The race loop is around seven minutes long.  It begins on a slightly
uphill paved section.  After a few hundred meters, it strays briefly
offroad to traverse two barriers, then back onto the road, climbing
past the finish line before turning hard to the left through four
inch-deep sand.  It then descends and curves right to cross a fallen
tree, stretches out over a long and bumpy section, drops down two
loose, fifteen foot-tall shoots, and takes a tight S-turn.  It then
climbs back up through a run-up with barriers, goes through another
S-turn, another run-up, and a final S-turn through more four inch-deep
sand before returning to the road section.

<p>
I line up about ten minutes early, mindful of the need to hit the dirt
sections near the front.  There are twenty-four of us lined up in the
Men's B's; we're set to race for six laps.  We'll also share the
course with fifty-four Masters and single-speeders who will start
shortly after us, providing further obstacles as we begin to lap them
later in the race.

<p>
At the whistle, I take off hard, hitting the first set of barriers in
third wheel, miss my pedals remounting the bike and fall to fifteenth
or so, but hammer my way back into the top five by the turn onto the
dirt.  I concentrate only on holding position through the first lap,
observing how the guys in front of me handle the trickier bits of the
course.

<p>
By the time we reach the starting line again, I'm feeling really
confident.  As we go to cross the first set of barriers again,
however, disaster strikes: my left pedal sticks as I go to unclip, and
I slam into the first barrier and then the ground.  Worse yet, I've
thrown my chain, and I lose at least ten places getting everything
back together.  So much for the Mental Edge.

<p>
I'm now really pissed off, as I replaced my old Speedplay Frogs with
these new pedals precisely in fear of just this sort of thing
occurring.  My anger fuels me as I hammer the hell out of the next
lap, working my way back into the top five, only to crash AGAIN on the
EXACT same barrier in the EXACT same way, AGAIN losing several places.
WTF?

<p>
Now I'm beyond mad; I'm about to throw a fit.  I hammer the next lap
even harder, ignoring the stitch developing in my gut.  Thankfully, I
clean the barriers the next time, allowing me to relax a bit and
concentrate only on pulling in the guys in front of me, noting in the
process that first place is still in view occasionally when the course
turns back on itself.

<p>
With a lap to go my confidence is back; my handling may be terrible,
but on fitness I'm feeling great.  As we pass the line, I scream at
the bell ringer, "What place?  What place?"  He responds that he
thinks I'm in fourth, but "fifth place is right behind you!"  Yeah,
but that means third is right in front of me, I think.

<p>
I proceed to pull third in, unclipping my inside foot as I come around
him through a tight, loose right turn, then punching it up the
following rise to cement my new position.  I can see what I presume is
second place fifty meters ahead; why settle for third?

<p>
As I come through the last sand pit, I throw a shoulder into a tubby
Masters racer as he tries to crash us both out, returning to the
pavement to see second place now only thirty meters up the road.  I
set my forearms on my bars, drop it into the big ring, and mash the
pedals like there's a bear on my ass.  I catch him halfway to the
barriers and draft him to the dismount.  We cross the barriers side by
side, remount, and sprint.  My head is down, my legs are burning, and
I'm starting to scream when I notice that he's long gone.  I smile and
relax as I cross the line, trying to look good for the photographer
before collapsing for lack of oxygen.

<p>
As it turns out, the bell ringer had it wrong; I was actually in fifth
with a lap to go, meaning I finished in third, not second.  Still,
it's a podium spot in my first CX race, and despite crashing twice,
I've finished only twenty-three seconds off first place.  Now if I can
just learn to get out of my pedals reliably...

<p>
Good luck next weekend to all you ECVers on the East Coast,<br>
