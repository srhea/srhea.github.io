<p>
A <i>stage race</i> is a race that consists of several, independent
races, called <i>stages</i>, run over multiple days.  As with normal
races, there are prizes and points awarded for the top placings in each
stage.  There are also prizes and points for the lowest cumulative time
after the final stage; this ranking is called the <i>general
classification</i> (GC).

<p>
Since my <a href="">last race report</a>, I've done two stage races--the
Mt. Hood Cycling Classic and the Elkhorn Classic Stage Race--both in
Oregon.  Each of these races was several days long and a full day's drive
away.  They're grueling, painful affairs.

<p>
They are also a great way to earn upgrade points.  For upgrading from
Cat 3 to Cat 2, the breakdown is like this:
<center>
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><i>Event</i></td><td><i>Places</i></td>
    <td><i>Point Breakdown</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Road Stage</td><td>1st-8th</td>
    <td>10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Criterium Stage</td><td>1st-6th</td>
    <td>7-5-4-3-2-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>GC</td><td>1st-15th</td>
    <td>20-17-15-13-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
There's a limit of 20 points per racer per stage race, but with only 25
points needed to upgrade to Cat 2, it should be clear that stage races
are a great opportunity for cyclists who can ride hard for multiple
consecutive days.

<p>
In addition to multiple road race and criterium stages, each stage race
usually contains a <i>time trial</i>.  Unlike the other stages,
time trials are not mass start events; racers are started thirty seconds
apart and are not allowed to draft during the race.  This limitation
renders all of the usual cycling tactics useless; there are no
pacelines, no breakaways, and no blocking.  The cyclist that turns the
biggest gear longest, while at the same time holding the most
aerodynamic position, is the one that wins.  Also unlike the other stages,
there are no points awarded for the places in the TT, but with the
elimination of drafting, the time differences between racers can be
much higher than in the other stages, making the TT a very important
stage for GC position.

<p>
Mt. Hood went really well for me.
I held my own with the climbers on the first
day's road stage, losing only 19 seconds up the final hill.  I then put
in a great time in the second day's TT, placing fifth in the stage and
moving into third on GC.  The third day's 87-mile road race 
didn't move me around
within the GC, but left me with only a slight, five-second lead over
fourth place.  The final day's criterium was nervous and crash-filled,
but again I held my position, landing a spot on the overall podium.

<p>
Frank, on the left, is 41 years old.  I'm on the right, and I'm 30.
Ian, in first place, is 16.  Talk about an age spread!
It was a great day, and a great race.  I earned 15 points for my GC
placing and another 3 for my sixth-place finish on day 3.

<p>
I was going to write a longer race report about Mt. Hood, but in the
meantime I raced Elkhorn.  I didn't place as well there as I did at Mt.
Hood, but I did have one incredible day in the saddle.  Read on to hear
the story.

<hr width="10%">

<p>
The Elkhorn Classic consists of four stages run over three days.  It
starts with an 82-mile road race with 3,400 feet of climbing.  The next
morning, there's a 10-mile time trial, followed by a 45-minute criterium
that evening.  The race finishes with an epic, 101-mile road stage with
four long climbs, the last of which rises 2,000 feet in only eight
miles.

<p>
I did well, though not outstandingly, in the first two days.  I finished
seventh in the first stage, losing only six seconds to a two-man
breakaway that went with 4 km to go.  I had high hopes for the next
day's TT, but the 10-mile course was shorter and less challenging than I
would have liked.  Still, I managed to pull myself into fifth in the
GC.  Had it been as long as the TT at Mt. Hood, I think I might have
done even better.  The criterium that evening was fast and fun, but it
failed to shake up the GC.

<p>
With the two points I earned for placing seventh in the first day's road
race, I found myself with 23 points for the season--just two short of
the 25 I needed to upgrade.  I could meet my season goal of upgrading to
Cat 2 either by placing 7th or better in the stage or holding on to at
least 14th in GC.  Moreover, the guy sitting first in the overall, Greg
Gambetta of Davis Bike Club, had a large, strong team, and I expected
they'd reel in any breaks that slipped away early in the day, leaving
the final hill for us to slug it out.

<p>
At the same time, I was tired.  Not only on account of the last two
days, but just in general as well.  I'd been training hard since early
winter, and I needed a break.  Upgrade or not, I was planning to take it
easy for several weeks after Elkhorn.  But needless to say, I was really
hoping to upgrade first.

<hr width="10%">

The final road stage of a stage race is always crazy.  It's the last
chance people have to move up on the GC, so the attacks start early.
This stage was no exception, and so after 20 miles of racing I found
myself sitting in the peleton while a 12-person break hovered around a
minute off the front.  Two of the riders in the break--Joseph Cech and
Brandon Lynch--were in the top 10 on GC.  Max Polin, who'd placed sixth
overall at Mt. Hood, was also in there.  It was a potentially dangerous
move.

<p>
As I expected, several racers from Davis Bike Club quickly moved to the
front to pull the break back in.  The pace was fast, and five of the
riders in the break fell back to the peleton over the next 20 miles, but
the remaining seven added to their lead, which had grown to over two
minutes by mile 40.  Worse still, Davis Bike Club was looking exhausted.
It generally takes a well-coordinated effort in the peleton to pull in a
motivated break, and I couldn't see who in the group had both the energy
and the willingness to put out such an effort.  At the same time, we
still had 60 miles of racing to go, and there was always the
possibility that the break had gone too hard in establishing their current
lead; maybe they'd come back all on their own.

<p>
What to do?

<p>
I decided I couldn't risk it.  At least if I was off the front, I'd be
in control of my own fate, rather than just sitting in the peleton
hoping someone else would bring the break back.  Moreover, a couple of
guys attacked at the bottom of the second major hill, forcing my hand.
I went with them.  Shortly thereafter, two others joined us.  

<p>
I'm always amazed at the way a break gets away.  
Just like in the <a href="2007-05-12_Berkeley_Hills_RR.html">Berkeley 
Hills Road Race</a>, our move felt doomed for the longest time.
At one point, they pulled us back to within 100
meters.  Then all of a sudden it felt like the pack just gave up, and
the next thing we knew, we were out of sight.  

<p>
I would then spend the next 60 miles yelling.

<p>
"Don't forget to eat and drink!  We've got several more hours until the
finish!"

<p>
"Keep the rotation smooth!  Take a short pull and then pull off!"

<p>
Just when I think I might as well shut up, 
Max rides up to me and says, "Don't stop.
Every time you quiet down, they stop working."  So I keep on, getting
progressively more frantic as our fatigue level rises.

<p>
"You know what's going on back there in the pack?  They hate each other
right now.  Everyone's yelling at everyone else to take a pull, and no
one wants to.  They're thinking: `Who's going to bring back the break?'
It's our cooperation that keeps us away!"

<p>
"Think of how Greg Gambetta feels right now!  He's back there, saying to
himself, 'How the hell did I lose a 20-second lead on GC?'"

<p>
"You're going to be telling this story for years!  The day you broke
away 40 miles into the final day of Elkhorn and held it to the finish!"

<p>
My favorite part of being in a breakaway is how the shared suffering
binds everyone together.  After an hour off the front, we're all patting
each other on the back, saying things like, "Good pull!" or, "You're
looking beat.  Why don't you sit out a rotation?"  Until we finish or
get caught, we're all brothers.

<p>
Or we would be, except that the race ends in a climb, which we reach
with a slim, two-minute lead on the peleton.  Once the road pitches up,
the wind is no longer the dominating factor, and only Max, Joseph, and I
continue to take turns at the front.  More and more, I can hear the
others breathing behind us.  

<p>
On the fifth or sixth switchback of the climb, someone yells, "There's
the pack!" and sure enough, we can see them just hitting the base of
the hill below.  "Get to the left of the road!" I yell, "Don't let them
see us or they'll chase harder!"

<p>
Whether they see us or not, I see them, and my pace quickens.  Max
takes turns pulling with me, but Joseph has dropped back now, too.
Soon, only the three of us and Nils Johnson of Davis bike club remain.
With his teammate in first on GC, Nils has had the good fortune 
to sit on the back of the
break all day; no one expects him to work, and he's looking like the
favorite for the stage win.

<p>
Twenty minutes into the climb, Max asks me to pull through, and I
refuse.  "Don't you dare attack me!" he responds, but he has nothing to
worry about.  Looking down at my bike computer, I see that I'm barely
putting out 250 watts, a pace I can normally maintain with ease, yet my
legs feel like I'm going all-out.  Max continues to pull at a hard,
steady pace, but then Nils attacks.  Only Max can respond, leaving
Joseph and I on our own.  

<p>
It's a terrible feeling to be dropped.  It's a long, steep climb, and I
can see Max and Nils for a long time.  It's clear what I need
to do.  I need to bridge back up and sit on their wheels.  But I can't.
I stand up, I mash the pedals, I try to will my legs back up to 350
watts, but they refuse.  And so I sit and grind my way along, keeping
the power as I high as I can.  And Joseph sits on, refusing to pull through.
I know what he's doing, but I'm worried only about putting time on the
main pack.  

<p>
At 3 km from the finish, Joseph finally attacks; I can't respond, but he stops
gaining after putting only 50 meters on me.  Shortly thereafter, Andrew
Rosette of Second Ascent comes roaring by both of us.  Andrew wasn't in
the break.  It's finally happened; we've begun to be caught.  The only
question now is: how many more will catch us?

<p>
I bury my head in my bars and
hammer on.  I know we're close; maybe five minutes from the finish.  My
legs hurt so bad I'm starting to have trouble riding in a straight line.

<p>
With 1 km to go I look back and see Greg Gambetta leading a group of
five other guys only 50 meters back.  He is flying.  The contrast
couldn't be sharper: his cadence must be 110 RPM, mine can't be over 70.
I focus on the road ahead and push for all I'm worth.  With a
twenty-second lead over me in the GC, it doesn't so much matter whether
he catches me, but I can't let the other five racers he's bringing with
him gain enough time to overtake me in the GC.

<p>
I manage to hold them until 200 meters to go.  Within sight of the
finish, they fly past me as they start their sprint.  I make one last
effort, standing and winding the pedals up as best I can, but there's
just nothing left.  Thought I don't quite manage to stay with them,
it's too late for them to put any real time into me, and I finish within
two seconds of Greg.

<hr width="10%">

<p>
As I lay on the ground at the finish, staring up at the sky, I wonder
whether I've done it.  I try to think which of the riders that past me
were in the top 10 before today, and whether they put enough time into
me to move me down in GC.  Honestly, I'm so tired I can't even remember
how many were up the road when I finished.  Was it 10, or 20?  My memory
is a blur.  I know for sure I didn't place high enough in the
stage to earn any points; but the GC ordering is escaping me.
Did I hold on for at least 14th, enough to upgrade?

<p>
Eventually, I give up.  I'm too tired to think straight.  Besides,
there's a guy across the road pouring beer from a portable tap.  I
struggle to my feet and leave my bike behind.  The beer tastes
wonderful, but it goes straight to my quads, and I have to sit back
down.  Max finds me, as do several others from the breakaway, and we sit
and drink beer and laugh while we reminisce about the incredible ride
we've just had.

<p>
Finally, they post the results: I held on for fifth, earning another 11
points and leaving me with a total of 34, 9 more than I need to upgrade.
As I stand there, reading the results again and again, I think of all
that went in to making this moment happen.  All of the nights I didn't
go out with friends.  All of the early mornings I rode for hours before
work.  The camping trips I skipped.  The pain of doing intervals alone.
All of these images are in my head as my mouth slowly creeps into a
smile, and I say quietly to myself, "I'm a Cat 2."

<p>
Your upgrade request has been approved. An upgrade sticker has gone into
the mail today and you should have it in a few days. Place this sticker
on the front of your license in a place where it doesn't coverup other
information on your license.

<p>
If you will be racing before you get your upgrade sticker in the mail
you can print out a copy of this message and bring it with you to show
proof of your new racing category to the registration people.

<p>
Upgraded to Cat 2 Road

292 watts during the last 30 minutes of the race.  Notice that my heart
